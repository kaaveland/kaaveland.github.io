It took a long time to discover that I had poor vision on this eye, you see, like many people, I chose to keep both of my eyes open when I wasnâ€™t sleeping. It was the headaches that sent me to a doctor. I was adamant that I could see well, but when he blocked my right eye, I had the humbling experience of no longer being able to read the biggest letters on the poster. It turned out that my headaches were probably due to my brain working overtime to interpret the world using mostly only one eye. My appointment with an optician was only a few days later, and I got to try a contact lens that same day.\nThe headaches were almost worth it for the childlike wonder I experienced that day, when I got to see what motion actually looked like at a distance. Thereâ€™s a particular tree in Mandal that I spent almost an hour just looking at, it was a windy day, and the motion of the branches and leaves was incredibly fascinating. I didnâ€™t know what I had been missing out on at the time. Thereâ€™s a good chance that my vision on my left eye had been bad for a very long time, or maybe it was never good to begin with.\nMy vision has gradually been getting worse on both eyes over the years, and so I make sure to visit an optician regularly. Whenever I end up with a new prescription, I take care to spend time appreciating what the world looks like, knowing that I wonâ€™t notice the day-to-day gradual decline in visual fidelity.\nPrescriptions in observability since 2013 Professionally, I donâ€™t have a lot of memories that come close to that story, but there have been many times when I felt like I got a prescription renewal:\nIn 2013, when I first got to set up Kibana and Elasticsearch, and could visualize my applications to a whole new level compared with grep and tail. I used to sit and write clever regexes, piping grep -o into sort | uniq -c so I could make visualizations before this. In 2016, when we set up InfluxDB and Grafana at Bring and started really caring about measuring things. This very much felt like the start of something great, and this culture still lives. In 2023/2024, when we set up Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Prometheus and OpenTelemetry at Sikt and I realized how easy it is to measure things now, how much of the work that someone else has already done for you. In 2025 at Sikt, when we enabled our telemetry stack for a bunch of applications where we had been only using logs before, all at once. Suddenly we could see clearly. It occurs to me that if I hadnâ€™t been paying attention to these things for many years now, just relying on logs, then been exposed to auto-instrumentation with OpenTelemetry in 2025, I might get an experience close to the day when I got contact lenses the first time, and thatâ€™s why the story is relevant.\nIf youâ€™re not using tools like these now, there are valuable facts in your world that are deeply hidden from you. Itâ€™s easier than ever to start using them, and you should. This post is the introduction to a series that will help you get started using OpenTelemetry aiming to cover a few different stacks, as well as one possible observability stack to use, and some examples of what that enables:\nThe JVM in general next.js and node.js cats-effects and zio The opentelemetry collector The grafana-stack, with tempo, loki and prometheus Not convinced yet? I realize that the two previous sections could look a lot like Iâ€™m trying to capitalize on FOMO, but Iâ€™m not selling anything, so please hear me out.\nOpenTelemetry is a community-driven initiative to standardize and specify protocols, APIs and semantics of observability data. All of the work is open, and anyone can implement the specifications. Someone probably implemented them for whatever tools youâ€™re using in the telemetry space already. You wouldnâ€™t bind yourself to any vendor or product by choosing to try it, in fact, it would make it very easy to try multiple and choose based on experience. Thatâ€™s one great thing about choosing open standards and specifications. Another one is that a lot of libraries now instrument their code with OpenTelemetry, so you donâ€™t have to do it yourself.\nBack in 2016 when I worked at Bring, we started taking metrics pretty seriously and blogged many times about stuff we did to get metrics. You can get this kind of data with almost no work now, and because the names, labels and values are now standardized, you can make dashboards that will work across a ton of different applications and runtimes. Back when I started getting passionate about metrics, we had to take care to set things up in alignment ourselves, and a lot of the time we needed several attempts to design the right sets of labels. Iâ€™m saying this, because this is work that is no longer necessary to undertake yourself in order to get things like:\nDuration metrics of all http calls made by all your applications labeled by the status codes and host names they were trying to reach. Duration metrics of all http calls made to your applications labeled by the status codes they resulted in and their http route. Connection pool usage in your applications. Correlation ids propagating all the way from the client into all of the backends that process the requests, transitively. Business value of telemetry All of that stuff is great to have for operational stuff, debugging incidents that happen and solving bugs. Itâ€™s an amazing place to start where you get a ton of things for very little effort. But weâ€™re still just dipping into the surface of what we can do when we get comfortable using these tools. The most valuable things happen when we find some telemetry that aligns really well with business value. It could be a conversion rate, a time to convert, amount of orders processed or something else entirely. When we find something like this, we can monitor it and use it to pick up symptoms of unforeseen problems, things that are really hard to uncover without real users stressing the whole system.\nIf you roll out a new version, and the conversion rate immediately drops, you know thereâ€™s a problem. You get to roll back before any damage is done, before identifying whether the problem was due to some CSS change moving around buttons, a fresh validation error, a logic bug, a changed price calculation or something else entirely. People will often tell you that finding bugs earlier in the lifecycle is up to a 100 times cheaper than in production. At the same time, it is also true that we canâ€™t all afford the level of QA required to end up with 0 defects. You may well be at a level of QA where it is cheaper to optimize for fast detection of bugs and fast recovery time, than increasing the spend on QA. Investing a little bit in telemetry can go a long way in identifying problems before thereâ€™s an outage.\nThere are tons of other reasons to measure things. How many clients use this endpoint, what coordination is necessary in order to get rid of it? Can we develop a shitty first version of a feature and measure adoption before we refine it? Thereâ€™s an incredible amount of use-cases and the culture for finding them will come as people adopt the tools and see the value. I think OpenTelemetry delivers enough of the good stuff that people will want to learn more. It isnâ€™t perfect, weâ€™re talking about standards and specifications after all. There are plenty of warts to get annoyed at, but all of that stuff is far outweighed by how useful the good parts are. Adoption has been heading the right way for a long time already, and itâ€™s only going to get more widespread from here.\nNext part The next part of this blog is a collaboration with a colleague from work, and is available here.\n","wordCount":"1396","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-01-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-04-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Robin KÃ¥veland"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://kaveland.no/posts/2025-01-26-points-of-data/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Robin's blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://kaveland.no/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://kaveland.no/ accesskey=h title="Robin's blog (Alt + H)">Robin's blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://kaveland.no/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://kaveland.no/projects/ title=projects><span>projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://kaveland.no/eugene/ title=eugene><span>eugene</span></a></li><li><a href=https://kaveland.no/thumper/ title=thumper><span>thumper</span></a></li><li><a href=https://kaveland.no/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://kaveland.no/archives/ title=archives><span>archives</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://kaveland.no/>Home</a>&nbsp;Â»&nbsp;<a href=https://kaveland.no/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">ðŸŽ¶ These points of data make a beautiful line ðŸŽ¶</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-01-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 31, 2025</span>&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;1396 words&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;Robin KÃ¥veland&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/kaaveland/kaaveland.github.io/content/posts/2025-01-26-points-of-data.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#prescriptions-in-observability-since-2013>Prescriptions in observability since 2013</a></li><li><a href=#not-convinced-yet>Not convinced yet?</a></li><li><a href=#business-value-of-telemetry>Business value of telemetry</a></li><li><a href=#next-part>Next part</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>One of my most vivid memories is from the day in my late teens when I first got
