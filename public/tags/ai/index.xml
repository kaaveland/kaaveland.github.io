You peer down an incredibly long aisle with wooden bookshelves brimming with books. You can see multiple such corridors, all lit with a comfortable warm light. There&amp;rsquo;s a rich smell of old paper. You can hear some muted voices, perhaps arguing in a whisper. It&amp;rsquo;s perfect, but vast and difficult to make sense of. Just this day, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like such a terrible ordeal to just wander for a while, see where your legs take you. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll find something interesting completely by accident? The prospect is both exhilarating and daunting. The library appears endless, it feels like you could potentially find all sorts of exotic and interesting book collections.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
