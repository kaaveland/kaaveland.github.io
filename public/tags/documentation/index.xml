think it&amp;rsquo;s starting to look pretty good. I wanted to write down some of
my thoughts around the process so far, and some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s just been a few days since I ported my blog to hugo, so since I was
already feeling like I was up to speed on that, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d try using it
for the eugene documentation too. I experimented with a few different
setups around the &lt;a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/">hugo-book&lt;/a>
theme, but it ended up feeling like I was having to configure a bit
too much for my taste. I think it looked really nice, but the setup
felt a bit janky and complicated, with having the submodules and
everything in the eugene repo itself. I think my problem here is
just that doing this with hugo would require me to learn more about
hugo than I&amp;rsquo;m ready for right now.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
