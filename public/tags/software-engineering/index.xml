engineering. On the whole, it was a really enjoyable time and I&amp;rsquo;d like to have
the chance to do so again at some point. One of the least enjoyable experiences
from that time was to deal with big CSV exports. Unfortunately, this file format
is still very common in the data science space. It is easy to understand why &amp;ndash;
it seems to be ubiquitous, present everywhere, it&amp;rsquo;s human-readable, it&amp;rsquo;s less
verbose than options like JSON and XML, it&amp;rsquo;s super easy to produce from almost
any tool. What&amp;rsquo;s not to like?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
