a contact lens for my left eye. It took a long time to discover that I had poor
vision on this eye, you see, like many people, I chose to keep both of my eyes
open when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sleeping. It was the headaches that sent me to a doctor. I
was adamant that I could see well, but when he blocked my right eye, I had the
humbling experience of no longer being able to read the biggest letters on the
poster. It turned out that my headaches were probably due to my brain working
overtime to interpret the world using mostly only one eye. My appointment with
an optician was only a few days later, and I got to try a contact lens that same
day.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
