I've been using [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) for my blog for
a while now, and I don't really have anything negative to say about it. But for
a while, I've been wanting a more minimal theme. I ended up on the front page
of hacker news a couple of times, and the old theme had my face on all the
pages, which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. I was looking at some other
themes around the web, and I found [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)
which I absolutely loved. I followed instructions for how to set it up, and
it turns out that it only took me an hour or two to get everything up and
running. I guess I have to give credit to where credit is due, both Hugo and
PaperMod are really well-made, and easy to use. There's a lot more stuff that
Hugo can do, but I think I have everything I need set up for now.

It's a bit sad that the old links no longer work, but the posts should be easy
to find for anyone who ends up with a `404` anyway.
