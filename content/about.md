I am Robin and this blog is a place where I can write about things I find
interesting. I'm a software engineer, living near Trondheim, Norway. I work
as a consultant for [Arktekk](https://arktekk.no/). There are lots of topics
related to my work that I'd like to write about:

- Things I learn. In my line of work, I learn something new almost every day and
  I'd like to get better at writing down some of those things.
- Debugging and tools for debugging complex systems. I love a good debugging
  story and while I try to avoid outages as much as possible, I do enjoy the
  intense concentration and focus that a production incident requires.
- Some technology. These days, I'm enjoying Rust a lot but I have a lot more
  experience with languages like Java and Python, and I really like PostgreSQL.
  I've also done some machine learning at work, and I really like wrangling
  and trying to understand tabular data.
- Working in teams and building culture. I've had the great fortune of being
  part of several teams with great culture for learning and while I don't know
  all of the ingredients that made that happen, I'm super interested in making
  it happen again.
- I'm programming Scala again for the first time in about 10 years, so I'm
  hoping to write a bit about how that experience is now.

I have some hobbies that I might write about at some point too, particularly
when they overlap with technology in some way:

- Fishing. The chances of finding me near a lake between May and October are
  reasonably good.
- Photography. I wanted to take the nicest landscape photos, but after my son
  was born I'm mostly taking only family photos.

I used to blog a little bit during my stint in Posten/Bring, so you can read
some of my previous blog posts [here](https://developer.bring.com/blog).
