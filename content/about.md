I am Robin and this blog is a place where I can write about things I find
interesting. I'm an experienced software engineer, living in Trondheim, Norway.
I work as a consultant for [Arktekk](https://arktekk.no/). There are lots of topics
related to my work that I'd like to write about:

- Things I learn. In my line of work, I learn something new almost every day, and
  I'd like to get better at writing down some of those things.
- Debugging and tools for debugging complex systems. I love a good debugging
  story and while I try to avoid outages as much as possible, I do enjoy the
  intense concentration and focus that a production incident requires. There's
  always something to learn from an outage and I like taking part in blameless postmortems.
- Some technology. These days, I'm enjoying Rust a lot, but I have a lot more
  experience with languages like Java and Python, and I really like PostgreSQL.
  I've also done some machine learning at work, and I really like wrangling
  and trying to understand tabular data.
- Working in teams and building culture. I've had the great fortune of being
  part of several teams with a great culture for learning and sharing, and while I don't know
  all the ingredients that made that happen, I'm super interested in making
  it happen again. Being part of a high-performing team is a great!
- I'm programming Scala again for the first time in about 10 years, so I'm
  hoping to write a bit about how that experience is now.
- I do a lot of data exploration, and it might be fun to post some of that
  here, in general I have a lot of "I wonder if" moments that I end up
  checking by pulling in data from places like
  [data.norge.no](https://data.norge.no/) or [SSB](https://www.ssb.no/).

I have some hobbies that I might write about at some point too, particularly
when they overlap with technology in some way:

- Fishing. The chances of finding me near a lake between May and October are
  reasonably good.
- Photography. I wanted to take the nicest landscape photos, but after my son
  was born I'm mostly taking only family photos.

I used to blog a little bit during my stint in Posten/Bring, so you can read
some of my previous blog posts [here](https://developer.bring.com/blog).

## Experience

Here are some technologies and problems that I have a lot of experience working with:

- Java/Kotlin/Scala (backend development, web)
- Python (data analysis and machine learning, devops, backend development)
- Spark (Databricks), pandas, torch
- PostgreSQL, both ops and using it as a developer
- Devops and CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Gitlab CI/CD, Jenkins
- Terraform, Kubernetes, Puppet, Ansible, Docker
- Grafana, InfluxDB, ELK stack, OpenTelemetry
- Azure
- Building data platforms, data engineering, data analysis

These things spark joy right now, and I would love to get to work with them in the future:

- European cloud providers
- Polars, Databricks
- Google BigQuery, Google Cloud
- Rust
- Building great teams, creating a culture around learning and sharing
- Building data platforms, data engineering, data analysis
- Building things that make other developers more productive, making the build and deploy process fast and reliable
